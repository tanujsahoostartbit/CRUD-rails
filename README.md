## Project Architecture
CRUD-rails project is a sample online rental store, which makes use of sample database with a few table additions.

#### Project uses following tables from sakila database:
* Table Name
* Actor
* Address
* Category
* City
* Country
* Customer
* Film
* Film Actor
* Film Category
* Inventory
* Rental


#### Added tables:
* Admin
* Customer Payment Info
* Rental Pending
* Staff


#### Tables are inter-connected through foreign keys or through other tables, and those connections are defined in project's app/models:

| Table 1 connects	| Table 2				| through table	| through foreign key 	|
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| actor				| film					| film_actor	|					  	|
| film 				| category 				| film_category	|						|
| film 				| inventory 			| 				| film_id				|
| film 				| rental 				| inventory 	| 						|
| film 				| rentals_pending		| 				| film_id 				|
| customer 			| rental 				| 				| customer_id 			|
| customer 			| inventory 			| rental 		| 						|
| customer 			| films 				| inventory 	| 						|
| customer 			| customer_payment_info	| 				| customer_id 			|
| customer 			| address 				| 				| address_id 			|

#### The project has 3 category of participants with their functions:

* Public: reads `film, actor` tables, creates account in `customer` table, places order by creating row in `rental_pending` table (before checkout, application requires to create an account)
* Staff: reads `rental_pending` table, processes order by locating item from `inventory` table, ships item to customer's address & creates record to `rental` table
* Admin: creates, reads, updates, deletes `actor, film, customer, staff` tables
